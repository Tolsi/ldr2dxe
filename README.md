ldr2dex
=======

small python script to turn Blackfin loader files (.LDR) back to VisualDSP executable files (.dex)

**ATTENTION:**

This is not working yet as I need to figure some more stuff about the LDR format out before completing this.
Also: This is basically my first python program apart from small network packet fuzzers and the like, so be gentle with me.
